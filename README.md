## Description

The **Comprehensive Churn Prediction and Analysis** project leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict customer churn and analyze key factors contributing to it. By examining variables such as gender, age, tenure, payment methods, and geographical location, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can help in developing targeted retention strategies and improving overall customer satisfaction.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Customers**  
   The total number of customers in the dataset, representing the current customer base.

2. **New Joiners**  
   The number of customers who have recently joined the service, indicating customer acquisition trends.

3. **Total Churn**  
   The total number of customers who have left the service, highlighting the scale of customer loss.

4. **Churn Rate**  
   The percentage of customers who have churned out of the total customer base, used to measure the rate of customer attrition.

## Features

- **Customer Demographics Analysis**  
  Examine customer attributes such as age, gender, and marital status.

- **Geographic Distribution**  
  Analyze churn rates across different geographical regions.

- **Payment Method Impact**  
  Evaluate how different payment methods affect customer churn.

- **Tenure and Churn Relationship**  
  Understand how the length of customer tenure influences the likelihood of churn.

- **Predictive Modeling**  
  Implement machine learning models to forecast future churners based on historical data.

## Use Case

1. **Marketing Interventions**  
   Identify potential areas for targeted marketing efforts by analyzing churner profiles and demographic data.

2. **Customer Retention**  
   Develop strategies to improve customer retention by understanding factors that contribute to churn.

3. **Strategic Planning**
